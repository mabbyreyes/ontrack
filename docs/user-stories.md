# User stories

* As a teenager who grew up with smart phones, I want to spend more time living in the moment instead of being glued to my phone so that I focus more on my mental and physical health.

 
* As a University student, I spend a lot of time I should be spending on studying for my exam going through social media. I need an app to motivate me to keep my hands off my phone for an hour or two while I focus on getting a great score on my test.


* As a parent of two girls, my teenagers are always on their phone whenever we try to spend family time together. We need an app to encourage them to give up even just half an hour to communicate and bond during family dinners.
