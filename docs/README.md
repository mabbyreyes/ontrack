## Description
onTrack is an application for people trying to be in the moment. This app helps keep you on top of your studying by keeping you off what distracts you from doing most anything; your phone. As the set time goes by, onTrack begins creating a complete puzzle piece. If, however, you choose to leave the app, your puzzle piece becomes nothing more than scrunched paper. The determination to complete the puzzle of every stunning downloadable/sharable image of Albuquerque NM will motivate you to spend your time elsewhere, create better studying habits, and stay off your phone.
